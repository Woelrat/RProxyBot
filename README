This is a client api for the Starcraft bot proxy found on http://eis.ucsc.edu/StarProxyBot

It is not complete yet and has no tests yet so it might not work without error.

At the moment I test it by launching irb, then typing require 'proxybot'. It will say "Waiting for client" now you launch starcraft with the clientmodule injected and start a game. When the game has started you will get back control in irb and you can get an instance of proxybot like this: p = RProxyBot::ProxyBot.instance

Now you can do things like p.map.chokes or p.map.players[2].ally? or p.map.walkable?(20,23)

At the moment StarCraft will crash after this because I immediately close the socket. 

Please contribute. I appreciate tests in rspec or cucumber :)
