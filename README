This is a client api for the Starcraft bot proxy found in the experimental branch of http://github.com/d-snp/bwapi-proxy 

It is not complete yet and has no tests yet so it might not work without error.

I now have a working stateless repl. You can run it by cd'ing to RProxyBot and then running: ruby proxybot.rb

Now you can do things like map.chokes or map.players[2].ally? or map.walkable?(20,23) or player.minerals

At the moment StarCraft will crash after this because I immediately close the socket. 

Please contribute. I appreciate tests in rspec or cucumber :)
