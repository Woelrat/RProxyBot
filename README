This is a client api for the Starcraft bot proxy found in the experimental branch of http://github.com/d-snp/bwapi-proxy 

Warning: only tested on Ruby 1.9, 1.8.7 throws an error, if you find a fix let me know :)

It is not complete yet and has no tests yet so it might not work without error. 

I now have a working stateless repl. You can run it by cd'ing to RProxyBot and then running: ruby proxybot.rb, this will at the moment also run the basic_ai, which resides in basic_ai.rb and does nothing but send all workers to the minerals closest to the command_center.

In the REPL you can do things like map.chokes or map.players[2].ally? or map.walkable?(20,23) or player.minerals

Please contribute. I appreciate tests in rspec or cucumber :)

You can contact me per e-mail at: (mail) @ (tinco.nl)
I am also in the #bwapi channel on quakenet with the handle d-snp
